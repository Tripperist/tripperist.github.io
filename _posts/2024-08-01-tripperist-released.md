Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.

We have published the *Tripperist - Mile 0 Release (1.0.1)* to a closed test track on Google Play. I had AI write the marketing copy for me, so it won't live up to the hype (yet).

It's still very basic, but I needed to get something out to get feedback on. Next time you drive somewhere (as a passenger) pull it up and see whats around.

The Maps and Trips detail screen are a work in progress. We are still trying to figure out the UX on that.

If you have an Android Phone I would appreciate you taking it for a test drive. **Email us your Google Play Account** so we can add you to our list of testers.
