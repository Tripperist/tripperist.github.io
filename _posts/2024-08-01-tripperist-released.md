Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.

We're thrilled to announce the launch of Tripperist, a new app designed to enhance your road trip experience. While we're still in the early stages of development, we're excited to share our initial release, *Tripperist - Mile 0 Release (1.0.1)*, with a select group of testers on Google Play.

This first iteration of Tripperist focuses on providing a streamlined experience for discovering points of interest along your route. As a passenger, simply open the app and explore nearby attractions, restaurants, and more. We're actively working on refining the user experience for both our *Maps* and *Trips* detail screens, and we'd love to hear your feedback!

It's still very basic, but I needed to get something out to get feedback on. Next time you drive somewhere (as a passenger) pull it up and see whats around.

The Maps and Trips detail screen are a work in progress. We are still trying to figure out the UX on that.

If you have an Android device, we encourage you to take Tripperist for a test drive. We're actively seeking user feedback to shape the future of the app. To participate in our closed beta program, please **email your Google Play Account email address** to *tripperista@gmail.com*.
