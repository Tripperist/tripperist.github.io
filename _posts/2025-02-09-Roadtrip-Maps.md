Every road trip I take, the first thing I do is create a Google Maps project. I then plan my a theme or a rough route. For most of my trips, I usually plan on 7 nights. 

It's a fun way to do some research for **Tripperist**, and all of these trips and places end up in the app.

Here they are with the most recent first...

 1. [2025.03 - St. Louis Route 66 to Tulsa - Back to the Delta](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/3/edit?mid=1Hxfy67D6RmpA0JWRnFN4gdzwHJ169dE&usp=sharing)
     - I'm planning on taking this trip the beginning of March. It's still in the planning stages. This drive will take Route 66 from St. Louis to Tulsa. Finishing another segment of Route 66. See the *Dallas Route 66 to Tulsa Triangle* map below for the Amarillo to Tulsa leg. It then goes from Tulsa to the Mississipi Deltat to hit up a couple of my favorite towns, before making a stop in Memphis, and then back up to St. Louis.
 
 1. [2024.09 - Ohio in 6 Nights](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/3/edit?mid=1ZStKdRzTy5P8JVPJU4jEZTrIkAr8kLE&usp=sharing)
     - I took this trip to visit my college roomate who I haven't seen in almost 20 years. Hence the detour into Windsor, Ontario.  I had to theme it around something, and chose Ohio. I even made a stop in Springfield, OH to have lunch at a Haitian restaurant. This was about a week after that famous claim.

 1. [2024.03 - New Orleans to Mississipi](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/3/edit?mid=1JSUYAfGrodmMAa7qlVO6BYRPbpjvIUU&usp=sharing)
     - Ever since my Nashville trip to Mississippi, I knew I'd be making regular trips back to the Delta. It's history, music, people, and food just keep me coming back. I would do this trip again and again.

 1. [2023.09 - Nashville to Mississippi](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/3/edit?mid=1wFiIwzcc-qgD3YDYl-Zvvkd5jUpnXbk&usp=sharing)
     - My first trip to Mississippi. With a brief tour of some Nashville sites, this takes the Natchez Trace through some pretty sites to the Mississippi Delta. It was my first exposure to the land of the blues, and I'm hooked.
     
 1. [2023.03 - Gulf Coast Trip](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/3/edit?mid=1UJwCHbAVw2wCqp3Wa9FL8uOAQUM0ZXk&usp=sharing)
      - The Third Coast. I wanted to stay as close to the Gulf Coast as possible on this trip. It skirts the coast from Louisiana all the way to Boca Chica, Texas where you can get a pretty close view of the Space X complex. 

 1. [2022.09 - Dallas Route 66 to Tulsa Triangle](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/3/edit?mid=1-QQX66fc359wj0v4VkK4FKOk-fY4r5Y&usp=sharing)
     - The one that started it all (if you don't count my 3 Day road trip from Seattle to Las Vegas). From the Alien Gravesite, to Cadillac Ranch, Tulsa, and the Zipline on the way back to Dallas, this trip has it all.
