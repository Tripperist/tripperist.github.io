Level up your road trips.

### Why Tripperist?

I like to take road trips, not a simple get from here to there type of road trip, but a real get out and see the sights and eat some darn good food type of road trip.

I have FOMO, sometimes my extreme FOMO leads to a lot of detours that I should have missed out on. So I started Tripperist to help me manage my FOMO.

#### Places

If you've ever driven by a Historical Marker sign and thought, "Hmmm, I wonder what that is about. Should I stop and take a look?" the Places tab is for you. 

It lists all of the historical markers within a 25 mile radius of your current position, sorted by distance. Tapping on the name will bring up information on the Historical Marker, as well as a map showing it's location.

##### Map

The Map tab shows all of the Historical Markers within 25 miles of your current location. Selecting a Place pin allows you to get directions (using Maps) to get there from your current location.

#### Trips

The Trips page is a work in progress but has the greatest potential. It has curated road trips that I have taken. Such as Route 66, Mississippi Delta, and the Third Coast from New Orleans to Boca Chica.
