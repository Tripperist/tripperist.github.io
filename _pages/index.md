### Why Tripperist?

I like to take road trips, not a simple get from here to there type of road trip, but a real get out and see the sights and eat some darn good food type of road trip.

I have extreme FOMO, sometimes it leads to a lot of detours that I should not have taken. I started Tripperist to manage my FOMO.

#### Places

If you've ever driven past a Historical Marker sign and thought, "Hmmm, should I stop and take a look?" the Places tab is for you.

It lists historical markers within a 25-mile radius, sorted by distance. Tapping  the place will bring up information on the Historical Marker as well as a map showing it's location.

##### Map

The Map tab shows all Historical Markers within 25-miles on a map. Selecting a Place pin gets directions (using Maps) from your current location.

#### Trips

The Trips page is a work in progress but has the greatest potential. It has curated road trips that I have taken. Such as Route 66, Mississippi Delta, and the Third Coast from New Orleans to Boca Chica. You can follow in my tracks for a great road trip experience.
